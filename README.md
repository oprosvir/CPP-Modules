# CPP Modules

This repository contains a collection of C++ exercises, organized into modules. Each module focuses on different aspects of C++ programming.

## ðŸ“š Module Overview

- [cpp00](./cpp00)  
  *Introduction to C++ syntax and structure: namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and other basic concepts.*

- [cpp01](./cpp01)  
  *Covers memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and switch statements.*

- [cpp02](./cpp02)  
  *Focuses on Orthodox Canonical Form, fixed-point number implementation, ad-hoc polymorphism, and operator overloading.*

- [cpp03](./cpp03)  
  *Introduces class inheritance, including multiple inheritance and constructor chaining.*

- [cpp04](./cpp04)  
  *Explores subtype polymorphism via virtual functions, abstract classes, deep copies, and interface-like design using pure virtual methods.*

- [cpp05](./cpp05)  
  *The purpose of this module is to introduce us to repetition and exceptions.*

- [cpp06](./cpp06)  
  *Casts in C++: static_cast, reinterpret_cast, dynamic_cast.*
